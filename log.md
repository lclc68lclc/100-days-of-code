# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FreeCodeCamp's Tribute Page

**Thoughts:** As I was working through this simple tribute page, I realized that I should turn this into a full fledged home for my favorite author. People are always talking about her work, making adaptations of it and finding new ways to discuss it. I'd like to bring everything to one place.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started FreeCodeCamp's Portfolio Page

**Thoughts:** I've used Bootstrap and jQuery before, but I'd forgotten how robust and easy it makes web development. It's almost seamless. I'm looking forward to filling up my portfolio with past and current projects, so this will be my task for the rest of the week. I've also got to start an image catalog for my photos. Most experienced devs use Amazon Web Services, but I don't know if I am there yet.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp's Portfolio Page

**Thoughts:** Made lots of progress on my portfolio page. I'd like to expand the jQuery and work on the CSS. At the end of it, I'd like for my site to be so visually pleasing that people want to hire me. :) Next steps are uploading more screenshots of my work, turning that into a carosel, adding a contacts section and adding more style.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FreeCodeCamp's Portfolio Page

**Thoughts:** One is never truly done with a portfolio page, but I managed to meet all of the requirments to move on to the Javascript portion of Free Code Camp. I'd still like to add a carosel to my Portfolio section. Maybe also move the page to a real site.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Graveyard Django App

**Thoughts:** For a little background, I'd always had this idea to take invoices, parse the data and house it in a database. All the user would need to do is scan the invoices into the app (or email them to the apps' email address), and the database would automatically udpate to alleviate the need for manual entry. This could be useful for running reports and tracking whether something is paid. This works well if you have an accounting department or some outside source. Well, I got as far as testing it and running reports. My next steps were integrating the parsing tool, testing it and importing old data to test against. That was about a year ago. I shouldn't have let it go for so long, as I feel I can use in my everyday work. Needless to say, even though it sits in my Github, I'm kinda lost as where to start up again. Wondering if I should just go back to Front End.

### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on new Homepage for E-commerce site

**Thoughts:** I started a website for my mom's craft projects to help her sell them. It was something quick and painless, but I started creating a proper homepage for her site. If only I could get the carousel page to work.

### Day 7: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on new Homepage for E-commerce site

**Thoughts:** I continued working on a website for my mom's craft projects to help her sell them. It was something quick and painless, but I started creating a proper homepage for her site. I got the carousel bootstrap feature to work. Yay! I had to remove the code from codepen to test it locally and that's where I found the error.     

### Day 8: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: CSS Image Attempt and Eloquent JS Problem

**Thoughts:** Upon opening my daily Medium email I saw that there was a daily CSS image project. I thought it would be cool. It's hard. A lot harder than I thought. That's goes to the point that you shouldn't try to do everything all at once. I'm going to keep trying but not devote too much time to it. In conjunction with Free Code Camp's Front End Developer track I'm also reading Eloquent Javascript. At the end of the chapter I was on, there were three problems to solve. I worked on two of them.     

### Day 9: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp Counting Cards

**Thoughts:** I haven't worked on any of my own code, no HTML or CSS images. I think I have a firm grasp on all of the basic concepts and while those projects produce results (the ones that this Code challenge are looking for the most), I am deep in the trenches of learning. Today was Javascript functions and I managed (with a little help to figure out the counting cards problem. More ideas are flowing for apps so soon I will be able to apply what I know to projects with a little more depth.

### Day 10: January 13, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Worked on new Homepage for E-commerce site

**Thoughts:** I continued working on a website for my mom's craft projects to help her sell them. It was something quick and painless, but I started creating a proper homepage for her site. I've added all of the parts to make it a prettier page. There is more work needed, but it's nice for now.

### Days 11/12: January 14/15, 2017
**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp's Javascript section

**Thoughts:** I didn't make much progress over the weekend and I'm not even sure I hit one hour a for each day, but I did slug along. I worked through the Javascript section and I had hoped to be finished by today, but that didn't happen. A better goal is maybe by the end of this week so that I can combine the coding projects with Javascript 30.

### Day 13: January 16, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Drum Kit for Javascript 30 (Day 1)

**Thoughts:** I went through the tutorial to build the drum kit, checked my work and.....nothing. I'm tired and maybe seeing this code with a fresh pair of eyes will help. So it's back to work tomorrow.

### Day 14: January 17, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Drum Kit for Javascript 30 (Day 1)

**Thoughts:** I figured out my problem, it was two little backticks causing my data-keys to be undefined. This is also pointing out one of my fatal flaws: my lack of attention to details. Not sure if its gotten worse because of age, because of multi-tasking or because of distractions, but I have a means to stop it.

### Day 15: January 18, 2017
**Today's Progress**: JS + CSS Clock for Javascript 30 (Day 2)

**Thoughts:** This was a cool little tutorial as part of JS30. I also finished out the basic javascript section of FreecodeCamp, and did some coding for work (which I know does not count). It feels good to be coding so much.

### Day 16: January 19, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Variables with CSS/JS for Javascript 30 (Day 3)

**Thoughts:** This is a simple little thing that does some really cool things. The thing I like most is learning about the little nuances in javscript. From my limited understanding, I have been able to pick up on some key tools that I think will help me in the future.

### Day 17: January 20, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Algorithms with Free Code Camp

**Thoughts:** I worked on two algorithms.

### Day 18: January 21, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Array Cardio for Javascript 30 (Day 4)

**Thoughts:** Tutorial that reiterated the things I'd been learning through FreeCodeCamp. The reduce(), sort(), etc. methods are extremely helpful for managing arrays and working with data.

### Day 19: January 22, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Flex Panels for Javascript 30 (Day 5)

**Thoughts:** This tutorial showed how to make panels flex open and close. When it's closed it shows one word and when you click on the panel, it shows more words. The CSS was the real star of this show, and it makes me want to learn about flex.

### Day 20: January 23, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Algorithms with Free Code Camp

**Thoughts:** I will admit that I got very frustrated going through the algoritms. I used the Read-Ask-Search methodology to get through them, but it is really hard (they said it would be). I'm also learning that I am beginning to think like a programmer. I simply need to write it out in the lengthest way and then condense it into functioning code.

### Day 21: January 24, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Type Ahead for Javascript 30 (Day 6)/Algorithms with Free Code Camp

**Thoughts:** Type Ahead is a function that takes a JSON file and parses it so that when you begin to type a city or state, the letters highlight while it retrieves a match. This functionality is seen throughout the web and it is important to learn. Google uses similar functionality with their autocomplete. I also worked out an algorithm with no help (ouside of syntax as I'm still not good remembering all of it).

### Day 22: January 25, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Algorithms with Free Code Camp

**Thoughts:** I worked on an algorithm that checks the ending of a string (if its just one word, then the last letter) and returns if it is true. I was using regex to get it right, but I'm not sure if that is the right solution. I also found a new website, codingame. It lets you programming with games. It's so cool. I will be adding it into my immersion technique that I am using to learn front end.

### Day 23: January 26, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Array Cardio for Javascript 30 (Day 7)

**Thoughts:** We worked on the some(), every(), find() and findIndex() array methods. These are cool in that they add functionality and simplicity to your code.

### Day 24: January 27, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Fun with HTML5 Canvas for Javascript 30 (Day 8) and two Algorithms for FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: HTML5 Canvas was super fun. We used hsl and varying widths to draw on a canvas. It wasn't too hard to work through. The algorithms on the other hand were hard, but I got through them. Hopefully I make it through the intermediate ones.

### Day 25: January 28, 2017
**Today's Progress**: 14 Dev Tools to Know and Shift to Select Multiple Checkboxes  for Javascript 30 (Day 9 and 10)

**Thoughts**: It was cool to learn dev tools that I didn't know existed, especially the console ones. They will be extremely helpful going forward. The code we wrote for the multiple checkboxes is something that I can use at work, so I'll be testing it this week to see.

### Day 26: January 29, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Custom Video Player for Javascript 30 (Day 11)

**Thoughts**: The custom video player tutorial was really helpful, and that's one of the things I've come to appreciate most about learning with JS30. We make reusable code. Code that will in the future make our lives and jobs easier.

### Day 27: January 30, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Algorithms for FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: I did three Algorithms for FreeCodeCamp: Truncate a String, Chunky Monkey, and Slasher Flick.

### Day 28: January 31, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Konami Code and Slide In Scroll for Javascript 30 (Days 12 and 13) and Algorithms for FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: I did a tutorial on how to do keylogger events and slide in scroll. Slide in scroll is a really nice effect, but Wes says that without a debouncer, its heavy on the pages. I also did four Algorithms for FreeCodeCamp: Falsy, Seek and Destroy, Where Do I Belong and Caesar Cipher.

### Day 29: February 1, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Reference vs. Copy for Javascript 30 (Day 14)

**Thoughts**: Worked on tutorial from JS30. Also completed the jQuery tutorial for FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 30: February 2, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Random Quote Machine project FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: Started on my random quote machine. 
**Link to work:** [Portfolio Page](https://codepen.io/lclc68lclc/pen/EZLYae)

### Day 31: February 3, 2017
**Today's Progress**: LocalStorage and Event Delegation for Javascript 30 (Day 15)

**Thoughts**: This tutorial was about doing get and post requests using LocalStorage (which is basically keeping information on the page even if you reload) Also used event delegation. 

### Day 32: February 4, 2017
**Today's Progress**: CSS Text Shadow Mouse Move Effect/ Sorting Band Names for Javascript 30 (Days 16 and 17)

**Thoughts**: This is a cool effect that makes a text shadow move when you hover over it with the mouse. The Sorting Band Names tutorial showed how to sort excluding the|an|a. 

### Day 33: February 5, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Tally String Times with Reduce for Javascript 30 (Day 18)

**Thoughts**: This was a simple tutorial to show how to tally all of the videos time.

### Day 34/35/36/37: February 6-9, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: Random Quote Machine project FreeCodeCamp/ WeatherApp project

**Thoughts**: Started on my random quote machine. I have spent countless hours on it. Countless, all because of the CORS issue with the api. It's the same on both projects. I found a workaround for the weather app, but the icon does not show. I fixed the quote button so now it works when you attempt to retrieve another quote. All that is left is fixing the tweet button so it works. And then I will have one project under my belt. It's really frustrating that FCC KNOWS this is an issue, and while the other students have been tremendously helpful, this is something that should be worked on. Most of my hours have been spent fixing this CORS error.  **Update**: I finished and uploaded the WeatherApp to FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 38: February 10, 2017
**Today's Progress**: The only thing I managed to do was install Node.js for an upcoming project with Javascript 30.

### Day 39: February 12, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Webcam Photo Booth for Javascript 30 (Day 19)
**Thoughts**: This was really cool and I learned a lot about setting up a node.js server (through trial and error), working with a camera and rgb values.

### Day 40: February 13, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Intermediate algorithm on FreeCodeCamp. 
**Thoughts**: I didn't make much progress.

### Day 41: February 14, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Random Quote Machine project FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: Spent lots of time working on this to get it submitted to FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 42: February 15, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Random Quote Machine/Wikipedia Search project FreeCodeCamp
**Thoughts**: VICTORY!!! I finally figured out the problem with my tweet button and once that was done, I was able to submit! That's two jQuery projects down and two left!!!

**Link to work:** [Wikipedia Search](https://codepen.io/lclc68lclc/pen/xgyyjL)

### Day 43: February 17, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Wikipedia Search project FreecodeCamp
**Thoughts**: Worked on the wikipedia Search project for FreeCodeCamp.
**Link to work:** [Wikipedia Search](https://codepen.io/lclc68lclc/pen/xgyyjL)

### Day 44: February 18, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Days 22-29 for Javascript 30
**Thoughts**: I binged coded on this day to finish up the JS30 tutorials. Six hours of non-stop coding. Wes Bos teaching methods are awesome. I want to take more of his classes.

### Days 45 - 47: February 19-21, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Wikipedia Search project for FreeCodeCamp
**Thoughts**: Worked on and finished the Wikipedia search project.
**Link to work:** [Wikipedia Search](https://codepen.io/lclc68lclc/full/xgyyjL/)

### Days 48 - 52: February 22-26, 2017
**Today's Progress**: TwitchTV project for FreeCodeCamp
**Thoughts**: Worked on and finished the TwitchTV project.
**Link to work:** [TwitchTV Streamers](https://codepen.io/lclc68lclc/full/RKXBKw/)

### Day 53: February 27, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Algorithms on FreeCodeCamp
**Thoughts**: Finished the Sum All Numbers in a Range and Diff Two Arrays

### Day 54: February 28, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Algorithms on FreeCodeCamp
**Thoughts**: Finished Roman Numeral Converter.

### Day 55: March 1, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Started CS50
**Thoughts**: I thought that today would be a good day to start CS50 to help me with completing algorithms.

### Day 56: March 3, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Worked on Portfolio
**Thoughts**: I've decided to re-design my portfolio to incorporate a blog and then I'm going to push it to a website.

### Day 57: March 4, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Worked on BE redesign
**Thoughts**: I had the idea (after reading a blog post on filling your portfolio with stuff) to redesign a website that I think has amazing information, but is very overcrowded, Black Enterprise. I pulled some of the design elements from the existing website that I want to carry over into the more minimal design that I have in my head. I realize that this is not technically coding, but design is important.

### Day 58: March 5, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Worked on Blog/CS50 Week 1
**Thoughts**:

### Days 59-60: Sometime between March 6 and 15th
**Today's Progress**: Worked on a conglomerate of things.
**Thoughts**: I thought that with a laptop to help me, I'd be able to code while on vacation. It wasn't as easy as I thought it would be. I have managed to listen to some CS50 here, I finished "You Don't Know JS: Up and Going", and started on the second one. I did a little bit of design on my blog. I looked at design stuff. So while I've managed to not completely forget everything that I have learned in the first 50 days, I wasn't able to do as much coding as I'd have liked. I'll be back to my daily schedule come Friday (which coincedently is St. Patrick's Day).

### Days 61-62: March 21/22, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Intro to Ajax Course
**Thoughts**: I took the course to get a better understanding of AJAX and CORS errors. I ended up building a site that takes an address and tells you things about the address you searched. It uses the google maps api, the New York Times API and the wikipedia API. When it works correctly, it's a neat web app. However, I couldn't get it to work. For some reason, the concept of CORS seems to allude me.

### Day 63: April 1, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Worked on Intermediate Algorithms
**Thoughts**: I have actually been coding or learning to code or reading about code, every single day. However, I have not been consistent with my log. So from here on out, I am going to log every day. Today was just algorithms from FreeCodeCamp. I hope to start on projects soon.

### Day 64: April 3, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Underline Hover Effect for Nav Bar
**Thoughts**: Worked on creating a hover effect for a nav bar. I want to integrate this into my portfolio/website.
**Link to work**: [Hover Effect](https://codepen.io/lclc68lclc/full/aJMOLJ/)

### Day 65: April 4, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Intermediate Algorithms
**Thoughts**: Finished the intermediate algorithms from FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 66-77: April 5-15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JS Calculator with FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**:Started on FreeCodeCamp JS Calculator. Only worked on the CSS, because I want to try my hand at Flex.

**Link to work**: [JS Calculator](https://codepen.io/lclc68lclc/pen/yMrZor)

**Today's Progress**: Was asked to redesign a website. Currently working on it.

### Day 79-81: April 17-19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JS Calculator with FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**:I have met all of the requirements for the calculator and I am almost ready to sumbit. I want to add the keypress function and add the decimal which allows for the float to be parsed. The Calculator is finished. Now I'm on to the tic tac toe game and the Pomodoro clock.

**Link to work**: [JS Calculator](https://lclc68lclc.github.io/jscalculator/)
