# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FreeCodeCamp's Tribute Page

**Thoughts:** As I was working through this simple tribute page, I realized that I should turn this into a full fledged home for my favorite author. People are always talking about her work, making adaptations of it and finding new ways to discuss it. I'd like to bring everything to one place.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started FreeCodeCamp's Portfolio Page

**Thoughts:** I've used Bootstrap and jQuery before, but I'd forgotten how robust and easy it makes web development. It's almost seamless. I'm looking forward to filling up my portfolio with past and current projects, so this will be my task for the rest of the week. I've also got to start an image catalog for my photos. Most experienced devs use Amazon Web Services, but I don't know if I am there yet.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp's Portfolio Page

**Thoughts:** Made lots of progress on my portfolio page. I'd like to expand the jQuery and work on the CSS. At the end of it, I'd like for my site to be so visually pleasing that people want to hire me. :) Next steps are uploading more screenshots of my work, turning that into a carosel, adding a contacts section and adding more style.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FreeCodeCamp's Portfolio Page

**Thoughts:** One is never truly done with a portfolio page, but I managed to meet all of the requirments to move on to the Javascript portion of Free Code Camp. I'd still like to add a carosel to my Portfolio section. Maybe also move the page to a real site.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Graveyard Django App

**Thoughts:** For a little background, I'd always had this idea to take invoices, parse the data and house it in a database. All the user would need to do is scan the invoices into the app (or email them to the apps' email address), and the database would automatically udpate to alleviate the need for manual entry. This could be useful for running reports and tracking whether something is paid. This works well if you have an accounting department or some outside source. Well, I got as far as testing it and running reports. My next steps were integrating the parsing tool, testing it and importing old data to test against. That was about a year ago. I shouldn't have let it go for so long, as I feel I can use in my everyday work. Needless to say, even though it sits in my Github, I'm kinda lost as where to start up again. Wondering if I should just go back to Front End.

### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on new Homepage for E-commerce site

**Thoughts:** I started a website for my mom's craft projects to help her sell them. It was something quick and painless, but I started creating a proper homepage for her site. If only I could get the carousel page to work.

### Day 7: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on new Homepage for E-commerce site

**Thoughts:** I continued working on a website for my mom's craft projects to help her sell them. It was something quick and painless, but I started creating a proper homepage for her site. I got the carousel bootstrap feature to work. Yay! I had to remove the code from codepen to test it locally and that's where I found the error.     

### Day 8: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: CSS Image Attempt and Eloquent JS Problem

**Thoughts:** Upon opening my daily Medium email I saw that there was a daily CSS image project. I thought it would be cool. It's hard. A lot harder than I thought. That's goes to the point that you shouldn't try to do everything all at once. I'm going to keep trying but not devote too much time to it. In conjunction with Free Code Camp's Front End Developer track I'm also reading Eloquent Javascript. At the end of the chapter I was on, there were three problems to solve. I worked on two of them.     

### Day 9: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp Counting Cards

**Thoughts:** I haven't worked on any of my own code, no HTML or CSS images. I think I have a firm grasp on all of the basic concepts and while those projects produce results (the ones that this Code challenge are looking for the most), I am deep in the trenches of learning. Today was Javascript functions and I managed (with a little help to figure out the counting cards problem. More ideas are flowing for apps so soon I will be able to apply what I know to projects with a little more depth.

### Day 10: January 13, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Worked on new Homepage for E-commerce site

**Thoughts:** I continued working on a website for my mom's craft projects to help her sell them. It was something quick and painless, but I started creating a proper homepage for her site. I've added all of the parts to make it a prettier page. There is more work needed, but it's nice for now.

### Days 11/12: January 14/15, 2017
**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp's Javascript section

**Thoughts:** I didn't make much progress over the weekend and I'm not even sure I hit one hour a for each day, but I did slug along. I worked through the Javascript section and I had hoped to be finished by today, but that didn't happen. A better goal is maybe by the end of this week so that I can combine the coding projects with Javascript 30.

### Day 13: January 16, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Drum Kit for Javascript 30 (Day 1)

**Thoughts:** I went through the tutorial to build the drum kit, checked my work and.....nothing. I'm tired and maybe seeing this code with a fresh pair of eyes will help. So it's back to work tomorrow.

### Day 14: January 17, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Drum Kit for Javascript 30 (Day 1)

**Thoughts:** I figured out my problem, it was two little backticks causing my data-keys to be undefined. This is also pointing out one of my fatal flaws: my lack of attention to details. Not sure if its gotten worse because of age, because of multi-tasking or because of distractions, but I have a means to stop it.

### Day 15: January 18, 2017
**Today's Progress**: JS + CSS Clock for Javascript 30 (Day 2)

**Thoughts:** This was a cool little tutorial as part of JS30. I also finished out the basic javascript section of FreecodeCamp, and did some coding for work (which I know does not count). It feels good to be coding so much.

### Day 16: January 19, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Variables with CSS/JS for Javascript 30 (Day 3)

**Thoughts:** This is a simple little thing that does some really cool things. The thing I like most is learning about the little nuances in javscript. From my limited understanding, I have been able to pick up on some key tools that I think will help me in the future.

### Day 17: January 20, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Algorithms with Free Code Camp

**Thoughts:** I worked on two algorithms.

### Day 18: January 21, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Array Cardio for Javascript 30 (Day 4)

**Thoughts:** Tutorial that reiterated the things I'd been learning through FreeCodeCamp. The reduce(), sort(), etc. methods are extremely helpful for managing arrays and working with data.

### Day 19: January 22, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Flex Panels for Javascript 30 (Day 5)

**Thoughts:** This tutorial showed how to make panels flex open and close. When it's closed it shows one word and when you click on the panel, it shows more words. The CSS was the real star of this show, and it makes me want to learn about flex.

### Day 20: January 23, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Algorithms with Free Code Camp

**Thoughts:** I will admit that I got very frustrated going through the algoritms. I used the Read-Ask-Search methodology to get through them, but it is really hard (they said it would be). I'm also learning that I am beginning to think like a programmer. I simply need to write it out in the lengthest way and then condense it into functioning code.

### Day 21: January 24, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Type Ahead for Javascript 30 (Day 6)/Algorithms with Free Code Camp

**Thoughts:** Type Ahead is a function that takes a JSON file and parses it so that when you begin to type a city or state, the letters highlight while it retrieves a match. This functionality is seen throughout the web and it is important to learn. Google uses similar functionality with their autocomplete. I also worked out an algorithm with no help (ouside of syntax as I'm still not good remembering all of it).

### Day 22: January 25, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Algorithms with Free Code Camp

**Thoughts:** I worked on an algorithm that checks the ending of a string (if its just one word, then the last letter) and returns if it is true. I was using regex to get it right, but I'm not sure if that is the right solution. I also found a new website, codingame. It lets you programming with games. It's so cool. I will be adding it into my immersion technique that I am using to learn front end.

### Day 23: January 26, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Array Cardio for Javascript 30 (Day 7)

**Thoughts:** We worked on the some(), every(), find() and findIndex() array methods. These are cool in that they add functionality and simplicity to your code.
