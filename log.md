# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FreeCodeCamp's Tribute Page

**Thoughts:** As I was working through this simple tribute page, I realized that I should turn this into a full fledged home for my favorite author. People are always talking about her work, making adaptations of it and finding new ways to discuss it. I'd like to bring everything to one place.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started FreeCodeCamp's Portfolio Page

**Thoughts:** I've used Bootstrap and jQuery before, but I'd forgotten how robust and easy it makes web development. It's almost seamless. I'm looking forward to filling up my portfolio with past and current projects, so this will be my task for the rest of the week. I've also got to start an image catalog for my photos. Most experienced devs use Amazon Web Services, but I don't know if I am there yet.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp's Portfolio Page

**Thoughts:** Made lots of progress on my portfolio page. I'd like to expand the jQuery and work on the CSS. At the end of it, I'd like for my site to be so visually pleasing that people want to hire me. :) Next steps are uploading more screenshots of my work, turning that into a carosel, adding a contacts section and adding more style.
