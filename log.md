# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FreeCodeCamp's Tribute Page

**Thoughts:** As I was working through this simple tribute page, I realized that I should turn this into a full fledged home for my favorite author. People are always talking about her work, making adaptations of it and finding new ways to discuss it. I'd like to bring everything to one place.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started FreeCodeCamp's Portfolio Page

**Thoughts:** I've used Bootstrap and jQuery before, but I'd forgotten how robust and easy it makes web development. It's almost seamless. I'm looking forward to filling up my portfolio with past and current projects, so this will be my task for the rest of the week. I've also got to start an image catalog for my photos. Most experienced devs use Amazon Web Services, but I don't know if I am there yet.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp's Portfolio Page

**Thoughts:** Made lots of progress on my portfolio page. I'd like to expand the jQuery and work on the CSS. At the end of it, I'd like for my site to be so visually pleasing that people want to hire me. :) Next steps are uploading more screenshots of my work, turning that into a carosel, adding a contacts section and adding more style.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FreeCodeCamp's Portfolio Page

**Thoughts:** One is never truly done with a portfolio page, but I managed to meet all of the requirments to move on to the Javascript portion of Free Code Camp. I'd still like to add a carosel to my Portfolio section. Maybe also move the page to a real site.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Graveyard Django App

**Thoughts:** For a little background, I'd always had this idea to take invoices, parse the data and house it in a database. All the user would need to do is scan the invoices into the app (or email them to the apps' email address), and the database would automatically udpate to alleviate the need for manual entry. This could be useful for running reports and tracking whether something is paid. This works well if you have an accounting department or some outside source. Well, I got as far as testing it and running reports. My next steps were integrating the parsing tool, testing it and importing old data to test against. That was about a year ago. I shouldn't have let it go for so long, as I feel I can use in my everyday work. Needless to say, even though it sits in my Github, I'm kinda lost as where to start up again. Wondering if I should just go back to Front End.

### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on new Homepage for E-commerce site

**Thoughts:** I started a website for my mom's craft projects to help her sell them. It was something quick and painless, but I started creating a proper homepage for her site. If only I could get the carousel page to work.

### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on new Homepage for E-commerce site

**Thoughts:** I continued working on a website for my mom's craft projects to help her sell them. It was something quick and painless, but I started creating a proper homepage for her site. I got the carousel bootstrap feature to work. Yay! I had to remove the code from codepen to test it locally and that's where I found the error.
